                    <p>Friendship is a mechanic within Stardew Valley which consists of building relationships with the
                        people of Pelican Town. There are various factors to building friendships which the game does
                        not explicitly tell players. The 3 main sub-mechanics that you will learn about are the points
                        meter, gifting, and heart events! </p>

                    <p>Friendship is calculated as a numerical value which may increase or decrease depending on your
                        actions. Though the exact number is not given in-game, a general representation of a range in
                        friendship is expressed using hearts within the social tab of the menu. Each heart represents
                        250 friendship points and will appear red for every heart amount reached. Every villager has a
                        maximum of ten achievable hearts, with marriage candidates having only 8 at the start. This
                        amount can be increased later if you decide to pursue them.</p>
                    <p>Another indicator is during direct interaction with a villager. An icon to the right of the
                        villager's portrait will be a specific color depending on how many hearts you have with them.
                        Each color represents every two hearts, starting at 0.

                                villager a gift per day with a maximum of 2 gifts a week. To see what gifts you
                                have given already, check the gift log located within the villager's page in the social

                        These events happen in specific locations when both you and the villager are in the same loaded
                        area. Some heart events are non-interactive while some gives you options that affect how the
                        scene plays out. Doing so may even raise or lower points so the best course of action is to
                        answer how you believe the villager would agree.</p>
