                    <p>In Stardew Valley, romance can be divided within stages that offer different interactions. This
                        page will go through each stage and the possible alternative routes you can have.

                    <p>To start dating someone, you need the maximum hearts (8) filled. Afterwards, Pierre will start
                        selling the Bouquet which can be gifted to initiate the dating stage. How he knows you need one
                        is beyond anyone but he does sell them for cheap which makes it accessible at any part of the
                        game.</p>
                    <p>Note that you can buy more than one; however, you can
                        only give one to a marriage candidate who has maximum hearts. Once you give someone bouquet, you
                        will unlock 2 more possible hearts and their status within the menu's social tab will change
                        to "Girlfriend" or "Boyfriend."</p>

                        <p>For some reason, you decided that this person may not be the one. That's okay! By putting a
                            Bouquet in a furnace, it will become a Wilted Bouquet. Giving this to your partner will
                            cause a break up and you will lose 5 hearts with them.</p>

                        <h3 class="border-box">Cheating</h3>
                        <p>It is possible to give a Bouquet to multiple marriage candidates. There is no real
                            consequence (other than questionable moral implications) until you have given a bouquet to
                            every bachelor OR bachelorette and seeing their 10-heart event. By doing so, you unlock the
                            Group Heart Event scene. The consequences from seeing this scene are quite light (compared
                            to the deplorable actions you have taken) and thus not worth spoiling. If you are
                            considering this... then good job! This route takes a lot of effort to reach. </p>

                    <p>To be engaged to your partner, you need the maximum hearts (10) filled and an upgraded house
                        (atleast once). Afterwards. Lewis will give some information about the Mermaid Pendant and
                        engagement traditions of the region. The Mermaid Pendant can be bought from the Old Mariner, who
                        resides by the trees of the tidal pools area at the Beach. He will only show up on rainy days
                        between the seasons of Spring and Fall; however, he can appear in winter after using a Rain
                        Totem. By gifting the Mermaid Pendant to your partner, you have successfully proposed to them!
                        Congratulations!</p>

                    <h3 class="border-box">Wedding Day</h3>
                    <p>On the calendar, there will be a Mermaid Pendant icon to signify what day the wedding will take
                        place. It should normally be on the fourth day after the proposal unless there is a special
                        event going on during the same day, in which the wedding will be postponed until the next
                        available day. Wedding days will always start with the ceremony and will always be sunny.</p>
                    <p>Once the wedding is over, the day will begin as normal at 6 in the morning. Your spouse will also
                        now appear in your home and there will now be an additional 4 more possible hearts with them.

                <div>
                    <p>When your spouse moves in, they will have their own room extension in the house and a small
                        outdoor area near the house.</p>
                    <p>Your spouse can help take some burden off your shoulders by doing some chores around the farm
                        such as feeding animals or repairing fences. Admittedly, by this stage of the game, there are
                        more effective methods of getting these done so it is not the most helpful... Spouses can also
                        change the wallpaper or flooring of rooms and place furniture. Other than being a slight
                        inconvenience, it is quite hilarious to see what they might do. All these interactions require
                        your spouse to be happy, which can be done how you regularly increase friendship points, with
                        the addition of kissing. Kissing can also remove exhaustion if you haven't kissed them that day
                        yet.</p>

                    <p>Once reaching 12.5 hearts (3125 friendship points), your spouse will gift you a Stardrop.</p>
                    <p>It is possible to make your spouse jealous if you give a marriage candidate (of the same gender
                        as your spouse) who had already recieved a bouquet from you, a gift. The exception is if the
                        gift is on their birthday or is given for an event or quest. There is only a chance of it
                        happening, though you will lose 30 friendship points if they do. </p>

                        <p>Useless. Don't have them. If you really do want them for the "roleplay" then all you need is
                            a nursery which is available after a certain house upgrade. After, your spouse will randomly
                            ask if you would want to have/adopt a child. PLEASE note that children do not grow past
                            being a toddler. There is no benefit in having a child in Stardew, though you can build up
                            friendship with them.</p>
                        <p>If you decided you do not want kids anymore, visit the Witch Hut (which is a late-game area)
                            to offer a Prismatic Shard in exchange of turning your children into doves. By doing so,
                            your children will be erased from your save but remnants of their existence will haunt your
                            game.

                        <p>Were they not the one? That's okay! In the Mayor's Manor, there is a small book which gives
                            the option to divorce your partner for 50,000 G. It can be cancelled before the end of the
                            day, or before 10 pm if you are not good enough friends with Lewis.</p>
                        <p>Once divorced, the spouse will move out to their original home and their room and outdoor
                            area will be gone. Anything placed within these area will be automatically placed inside a
                            chest inside your house. Your relationship with your ex will go back to 0 friendship points
                            and their status in the menu's social tab will be "Ex." </p>
                        <p>This does not affect any outside villagers. However, your ex will not talk positively towards
                            you and will not accept any gifts. They will not attend any future weddings for obvious
                            reasons.</p>
                        <p>To completely reset your relationship, visit the Witch's Hut (late game area) to erase all
                            ex-spouses' (if you have more than one, you heartbreaker) memories for 30,000 G. Do note
                            that any heart events seen previously will not appear again. </p>
